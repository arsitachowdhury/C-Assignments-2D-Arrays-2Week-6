int main(){
int a[][2] = {{1,2},{3,4}};
int i, j;
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)
for (j = 0; j < 2; j++)
cout << a[i][j];
return 0;
}

The output of the above code is 1234

The 2D array a is initialized with the values
The outer loop runs for i = 0 and i = 1
The inner loop runs for j = 0 and j = 1
In each iteration of the inner loop, it prints the value of a[i][j]
